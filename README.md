### Project Organization and Workflow

We are organizing our workflow with [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/Daniel-Gallagher92/projects/2/views/1).

We plan to use a Kanban board in Github Projects to track issues and assign to one another. This is our first time fully utilizing Github issues and a project in a team setting, so we are learning along the process.

Dissemination of tasks.

### How we decided our approach to project organization

We approach our project organization through a strong feedback loop. We present ideas, discuss, and update. We decided to organize using Issues and a Github Project because they are built into Github and pair easily with our codebase.

### Our Approach to Code Design

Our goal is to separate the concerns of each class to adhere to the principles of SRP. This will avoid the tangling of classes, and should make the debugging process easier if/when the .csv files change. We used a Miro board to experiment with our class design to not accrue technical debt from overlooking details before coding.
