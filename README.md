### Check-In Plans
* First checkin of weekdays `8:30 AM MT`
* ASYNC End of Day check-in on Slack
  * What we accomplished/if we're stuck
  * Link to EOD PR of work (even if it's incomplete)
  * Where we're going
    * Say what ticket we're going to grab next

### Project Organization and Workflow

We are organizing our workflow with [Github Projects](https://github.com/users/Daniel-Gallagher92/projects/2/views/1).

We plan to use a Kanban board in Github Projects to track issues and assign to one another. This is our first time fully utilizing Github issues and a project in a team setting, so we are learning along the process.

### How we decided our approach to project organization

We approach our project organization through a strong feedback loop. We present ideas, discuss, and update. We decided to organize using Issues and a Github Project because they are built into Github and pair easily with our codebase.

### Our Approach to Code Design

Our goal is to separate the concerns of each class to adhere to the principles of SRP. This will avoid the tangling of classes, and should make the debugging process easier if/when the .csv files change. We used a Miro board to experiment with our class design to not accrue technical debt from overlooking details before coding.

### Our DTR

[First DTR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SXkzyGqGDIJGaeulojm7_W0gFKu-bEAwNHpBEhKxTZk/edit) (completed June 6th, 2023)

**Top 3 things that went well during our project**
1. We were excited to use Github issues and Github Projects. The organization processes that we put in place made it easy to see what we needed to do and how much we had completed.
1. We had consistent communication throughout the project and significantly grew in our knowledge of the group development process.
1. We completed each method listed in Iteration 2 and made working code.

**Top 3 things we would do differently next time**
1. Become more familiar with the planning stages of group project work and start writing methods earlier to give ourselves more time to understand the code and refactor.
1. Develop more specific PR merging procedures in our DTR to help with asynchronous merges.
1. Break our code down into more classes and subclasses.
